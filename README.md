# Chicago Public Library Visitor Visualizations
## Created by: Christopher Carlsson, Rahul D'Mello, Nathan Parker

Hello! This readme provides the necessary details in order to take advantage of the Chicago Public Library visualizations.

Once this repo has been cloned, the file "chicagodash.py" can be run, which creates the dashboard of visualizations.

The first visualization "Monthly Heatmap" shows the count of visitors for a branch in a given month. The visitors are standardized in order to compare the smaller branches with each other. December has a notably lower visitor count.

The second visualization "Renovation Year" shows the last year that several branches had a renovation. This visualization has a way to filter which years were last renovated before a certain year, and reveals that North Austin is most overdue for a a renovation.

The third visualization "Geographic Rendering" visualizes the location of Chicago Public Libraries and the number of visitors they bring in each year. These libraries can then be compared by location.
